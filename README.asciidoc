= CharaCreator

This is (or will eventually be) a character creator made for the Computer Graphics course.
Right now it is still very much a *work-in-progress*.


== Building the project
=== Prerequisites

[horizontal]
Unreal Engine 5.3.2:: This is an UE5 project, so you will need the editor.

Clone the repository somewhere on your PC.

Open Unreal Engine. After it's open, select "Browse" at the bottom of the Project Browser. Find the project and select it.

After that, CharaCreator should show up. Select it and press Open.

After that, above the viewport, click Platforms and build it for your platform of choice. Only Windows has been tested.
Select a platform and press "Package Content".

Now you should have a build of the game, if everything went well.


== Releases

{1}[A very early Windows version]

== How to use

After booting up the project, you should see a screen with a bunch of buttons and sliders. Right now it's not very functional, but in theory, you will be able to change categories
with the buttons and adjust the length of different clothing objects with the sliders.

You might have to ALT+Tab to access the UI again, as there's no actual way to focus on the UI yet after you click into the game world.
